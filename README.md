Electronic Engineer specialises in Switch Mode Power Supply SMPS design but has a general interest in hardware and software design.
Principle Engineer at Ipeco Electronics lead a small multi disciplinary team, enjoy the challenge but get frustrated because I do not feel I am productive enough and feel that as a team we do not achieve much. Variety of reasons but main cause is there is no focus on one single job, there are too many interuptions and we do not complete work satisfactorily in the first place which means we have to revisit simple tasks many times.
